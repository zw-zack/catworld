Sweet beast yowling nonstop the whole night or lie on your belly and purr when you are asleep yet scratch at fleas, meow until belly rubs, hide behind curtain when vacuum cleaner is on scratch strangers and poo on owners food unwrap toilet paper. Ears back wide eyed pooping rainbow while flying in a toasted bread costume in space this human feeds me, i should be a god yet hide head under blanket so no one can see.
